# Gemini CLI Project Mandates

This file provides foundational mandates for Gemini CLI (gemini-cli) when working in this repository.

## Schema Change Workflow

**When a task requires Prisma schema changes, always show the proposed schema diff to the user for review and approval _before_ implementing the rest of the code** (API routes, types, UI, tests). This prevents rework when the design needs adjustment.

## App Architecture

- **Single-user bookings and promotions:** Each user has their own isolated bookings and promotions. Promotions and bookings are NOT shared across users. This means race conditions in redemption constraint checks are not a concern — no need to implement database-level serialization or row-level locking.

## Geo Property Search

- **API:** Google Places API (New) — `POST https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText` with `includedType: lodging`. Requires `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` env var (free tier ~$200/month credit; billing account required).
- **Server proxy:** `GET /api/geo/search?q=...` — authenticated route in `src/app/api/geo/search/route.ts`. Checks `GeoCache` first, calls Google on miss, caches results.
- **`geo-lookup.ts`:** `searchProperties(query)` — core search logic. Returns `[]` gracefully if API key is unset. Returns `placeId`, `displayName`, `city`, `countryCode`, `address`, `latitude`, `longitude`.
- **`countries.ts`:** Static `COUNTRIES` list (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), `countryName()` helper, and `ALPHA3_TO_ALPHA2` map.
- **Booking form:** Property name uses `PropertyNameCombobox` (confirmed/unconfirmed states) + `ManualGeoModal` ("Can't find your hotel?" fallback). `geoConfirmed` must be `true` to submit — free-form text is blocked by form validation.
- **Property model:** Geo data lives on `Property`, not `Booking`. `Booking.propertyId` (required FK) links to a `Property` row. The booking API calls `findOrCreateProperty()` (in `src/lib/property-utils.ts`) to upsert a Property from geo fields. When checking geography in promotion matching, use `booking.property?.countryCode` — NOT `booking.countryCode` (that field no longer exists).
- **`GeoCache` model:** Caches results by normalized query key. Clear with `DELETE FROM geo_cache;` after switching API providers.

## Price Watch

- **Architecture:** `PriceWatch` (per user/property) → `PriceWatchBooking` (per booking, holds thresholds) → `PriceSnapshot` (per price fetch).
- **Fetcher abstraction:** `src/lib/price-fetcher.ts` — `PriceFetcher` interface with `canFetch(property)` and `fetchPrice(params)`. Add new chain scrapers to `src/lib/scrapers/`.
- **Hyatt scraper:** `src/lib/scrapers/hyatt.ts` — launches Chromium in "App Mode" (`--app=<url>`) to bypass Kasada bot detection. Always `headless: false`; in CI `xvfb-run` provides a virtual display. No session cookie required. `parseHyattRates(data)` is exported for unit testing. Debug utility: `scripts/debug-hyatt.ts`.
- **Shared refresh logic:** `src/lib/price-watch-refresh.ts` — `runPriceWatchRefresh(fetchers)`. Contains all the Prisma queries, currency conversion, threshold checks, and email dispatch. Used by the worker script and tested directly in `src/lib/price-watch-refresh.test.ts`.
- **Email:** `src/lib/email.ts` — `sendPriceDropAlert()` via Resend. Requires `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`.
- **Worker:** `src/workers/refresh-price-watches.ts` — runs via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/refresh-price-watches.yml`) at 6am UTC using `xvfb-run npx tsx src/workers/refresh-price-watches.ts`. Requires `DATABASE_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` as GitHub Secrets. Trigger manually: `npm run prices:refresh` or `./scripts/trigger-price-refresh.sh`.
- **No cron API route for price watches** — `src/app/api/cron/refresh-price-watches/` has been deleted. The Playwright scraper cannot run in Vercel serverless. Only `src/app/api/cron/refresh-exchange-rates/` remains as an HTTP cron endpoint.
- **`chainPropertyId`:** Stored on `Property`. For Hyatt: the 5-char lowercase spiritCode from the property URL (e.g. `chiph` from `.../park-hyatt-chicago/chiph`). Set via the pencil icon on the `/price-watch` page, or via `PUT /api/properties/[id]`.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Library:** Auth.js v5 (`next-auth@beta`), JWT session strategy
- **Credentials provider** is used (email/password). Note: Credentials requires JWT sessions — database sessions are not supported with this provider in Auth.js v5.
- **`AUTH_SECRET`** env var is required and must be set in all environments (dev, test, prod). Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- **Middleware:** `src/middleware.ts` protects all routes. Unauthenticated requests redirect to `/login`.
- **Auth helpers:** `src/lib/auth-utils.ts` — always use `getAuthenticatedUserId()` to get the current user's ID in API routes; use `requireAdmin()` to guard admin-only write operations.
- **IDOR protection:** When fetching user-owned resources by ID, ALWAYS use `findFirst({ where: { id, userId } })`. Never use `findUnique({ where: { id } })` alone, as it does not verify ownership.
- **Ownership verification:** For PUT/DELETE on user resources, always verify ownership with a `findFirst` check before any writes — do NOT rely solely on the update/delete `where` clause.
- **E2E auth:** Tests use a Playwright `storageState` saved by `e2e/auth.setup.ts`. The `AUTH_SECRET` must be in `.env` for the test server to sign/verify JWT cookies.

## Engineering Mandates

- **Savings Explanations:** When adding new promotion types, portal reward options, or modifying loyalty logic, you **MUST** update the `getNetCostBreakdown` function in `src/lib/net-cost.ts` to include detailed, human-readable explanations (description and formula) for the new logic.
- **Cost Basis:** All explanations must explicitly state whether the calculation is based on the **pre-tax cost** or the **total cost**.
- **UI Consistency:** Ensure the `CostBreakdown` component (src/components/cost-breakdown.tsx) is updated as necessary to accommodate any new breakdown items or calculation types.
- **Benefit Value Consistency:** When redemption constraints cap promotion values (e.g., `maxRedemptionValue`, `maxTotalBonusPoints`), the individual `appliedValue` on each `BenefitApplication` must be proportionally scaled to maintain consistency with the total capped `appliedValue`.

### Promotion Matching & Orphaned Logic

Promotions must be matched and labeled according to three tiers evaluated in order:

1. **Structural Match (Invisible if Mismatched):**
   If any structural criteria fail for this booking, the promotion MUST be skipped entirely — hidden from the UI with no badge. There is no "structural orphan" state; structural incompatibility always means invisible.
   - **Fields:** Hotel Chain ID, Credit Card ID, Shopping Portal ID, Sub-brand Restrictions, Stay Dates, Registration Deadline, Book-by Date, Booking Source, Payment Type, and Tie-in Cards.

2. **Hard Caps (Maxed Out):**
   Checked before fulfillment. If a hard limit is reached, show $0 with no badge.
   - **Fields:** Max Stay Count, Once Per Sub-brand, Max Reward Count.

3. **Fulfillment (Pre-qualifying vs. Orphaned):**
   Evaluated only if structural match passes and no hard cap was hit.
   - **Pre-qualifying:** Campaign requirements not yet met (prerequisites, tiers, span-stays nights), but future booked stays exist that could complete it → Show $0 (or pro-rated value for span-stays) with **"Pre-qualifying" badge**.
   - **Orphaned:** Campaign requirements not met AND no future booked stays can complete it → Show **$0** with **"Orphaned" badge**.
   - "Orphaned" specifically means: not enough stays/nights accumulated across the campaign to earn the promotion.

#### Span-stays partial cycle display (`net-cost.ts`)

When a span-stays campaign ends with an incomplete final cycle (`isRemainderOrphaned`), completed cycles earn their full value and the partial cycle earns $0. The partial cycle segment label depends on whether the benefit cap was exhausted:

- **"Orphaned Reward Cycle"**: The cap (`maxTotalBonusPoints` or `maxRedemptionValue`) was NOT exhausted — the cycle simply ran out of eligible nights. Computed as: `floor(eligibleNightsAtBooking / minNightsRequired) × benefitValue < maxTotalBonusPoints`.
- **"Capped Reward Cycle"**: The cap WAS fully exhausted by all completed cycles across the campaign. Computed as: `floor(eligibleNightsAtBooking / minNightsRequired) × benefitValue >= maxTotalBonusPoints`.

`eligibleNightsAtBooking` (stored on `BookingPromotionBenefit`) is the cumulative eligible nights at the END of this booking (prior nights + this booking's nights). This is the source of truth for all span-stays display calculations in `net-cost.ts`.

## Testing Mandates

- **Verification:** ALWAYS run all unit tests (`npm test`) and E2E tests (`npm run test:e2e`) locally before creating or pushing updates to a Pull Request. A task is not considered ready for review until all local tests pass.
- **Test Coverage:** ALWAYS write unit tests (Vitest/RTL) for every feature or fix created. ALWAYS write E2E tests (Playwright) for features that involve UI flows. E2E tests run in CI.
- **Precise Selectors:** ALWAYS use `data-testid` attributes on React components for specific values or elements to be tested (e.g., `data-testid="stat-value-total-bookings"`). This avoids ambiguity and ensures tests are robust against formatting changes.

### E2E Test Design

**Isolation strategy:** Each test that needs data creates it via direct API calls and deletes it afterward. Tests MUST NOT create data through the UI — UI form navigation is slow and timing-sensitive (especially the date picker).

**Fixtures:** `e2e/fixtures.ts` exports a custom `test` object with reusable fixtures:

- `testBooking` — creates a booking via `POST /api/bookings` with a UUID-unique property name, yields it to the test, then deletes it via `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` after the test.

Always import `test` and `expect` from `./fixtures` (not from `@playwright/test`) in spec files.

**Reference data** (hotel chains, credit cards, portals) is seeded once in `e2e/global-setup.ts` and treated as read-only.

### Unit Test Design (Vitest / RTL)

- **Avoid Manual `act()`:** Use `render()` and `userEvent` (v14+) directly; they wrap operations in `act()` internally. Manual double-wrapping is redundant and can cause race conditions in the event loop.
- **Prefer `userEvent` over `fireEvent`:** Always use `userEvent.click()`, `userEvent.type()`, etc., to simulate full browser event lifecycles.
- **Centralize Common Mocks:** Always move common mocks (e.g., `next/link`, `next/navigation`, `Sentry`) to `vitest-setup.ts` to improve maintainability and ensure consistency across the test suite.
- **Prefer Targeted Component Mocking:** When dealing with complex browser behaviors (like focus management in Radix UI), prefer mocking the problematic component (e.g., `@radix-ui/react-focus-scope`) over globally mocking browser APIs (like `requestAnimationFrame`).
- **Radix UI Stability:** `vitest-setup.ts` contains global mocks for `FocusScope` and sets `userEvent.setup({ delay: null })` to maintain test isolation and prevent intermittent timeouts.
- **Timeouts:** Keep `testTimeout` at 30s in `vitest.config.ts` to ensure stability in parallel execution environments.

## Workflow Mandates

- **Pull Requests:** ALWAYS create a feature branch for any and all code changes. After implementation, notify the user to test the changes locally. ONLY create a Pull Request (PR) after the user has confirmed they have tested and approved the work.
- **Merging:** NEVER merge a PR or delete a feature branch until specifically instructed to do so by the user. NEVER apply changes directly to the main branch. A task is not considered complete until the PR is merged after user approval.

## GitHub CLI

- **Sub-issue linking:** When creating sub-tasks or sub-issues for a parent GitHub issue, ALWAYS formally link them as children using the 'Sub-issues' feature (via GraphQL `addSubIssue` or equivalent) so they appear in the parent's dedicated "Sub-issues" area.
- **Do NOT use `gh pr view --comments`** — it queries the deprecated Projects (classic) GraphQL API and returns exit code 1.
- To read PR review comments use: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments`
- To read general PR/issue comments use: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr}/comments`
- To read review summaries use: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/reviews`
